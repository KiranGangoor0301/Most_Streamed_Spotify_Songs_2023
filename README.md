# Most Streamed Spotify Songs 2023 Project

This repository contains the code and analysis for the Most Streamed Spotify Songs of 2023 using Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) techniques, including KNClassifier and clustering algorithms.

## Overview

This project focuses on analyzing and understanding the trends in the most streamed songs on Spotify in 2023. The ML and DL techniques employed here aim to provide insights into the characteristics, patterns, and clusters within this dataset.

## Installation

To run this project locally, ensure you have Python 3.x installed. Then, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/KiranGangoor0301/Most_Streamed_Spotify_Songs_2023.git
   ```
   
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd Most_Streamed_Spotify_Songs_2023
   ```
   
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
